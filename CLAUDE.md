# Rally The Troops AI Agent - Project Knowledge Base

## Project Overview

This project aims to create an AI agent capable of playing board games on the Rally The Troops platform, starting with "300: Earth & Water". 

**RESET PROJECT STATUS**: Starting from scratch after getting too complex. Focus on simplicity and core functionality first.

## Core Goal
Build a simple Python interface to play 300: Earth & Water games, then gradually add AI capabilities.

## System Architecture

### Current RTT Infrastructure

1. **Rally-the-Troops Server** (`/server/`)
   - Node.js-based game server
   - Handles multiplayer sessions
   - Each game has its own `rules.js` implementation

2. **300: Earth & Water Implementation** (`/server/public/300-earth-and-water/`)
   - `rules.js`: Core game logic implementing state machine
   - Key functions: `setup()`, `view()`, `action()`
   - Event-driven card system
   - Turn-based gameplay with preparation, operation, supply, and scoring phases

3. **RTT-Fuzzer** (`/rtt-fuzzer/`)
   - Coverage-guided fuzzer using Jazzer.js
   - Tests game rules with random inputs
   - Can detect infinite loops, crashes, and dead-end states

## Game Mechanics Summary

### 300: Earth & Water
- **Players**: 2 (Greece vs Persia)
- **Asymmetric**: Different resources and capabilities
- **Campaigns**: Up to 5 campaigns per game
- **Phases per Campaign**:
  1. Preparation (buy cards, raise armies/fleets)
  2. Operations (play cards for events or movement)
  3. Supply (check supply lines)
  4. Scoring (count controlled cities)

### Key Game Elements
- **Cities**: 12 locations with different strategic values
- **Units**: Armies and Fleets
- **Cards**: 16 dual-use cards (Greek/Persian events)
- **Combat**: Dice-based with modifiers
- **Victory**: Control enemy capitals or point advantage after 5 campaigns

## Technical Decisions

### Language Choice: Python with UV
- **Rationale**: Rich ML ecosystem (PyTorch, TensorFlow, Stable-Baselines3)
- **Package Management**: UV for fast, modern dependency management
- **Integration**: Bridge to Node.js game engine via subprocess
- **State Management**: Python wrapper around JavaScript rules engine

### ML Approach (Planned)
1. Start with rule-based agents (random, heuristic)
2. Implement MCTS (Monte Carlo Tree Search)
3. Add neural networks (AlphaZero-style)
4. Self-play reinforcement learning

### State Representation
- Board state: Unit positions, control, resources
- Hidden information: Opponent's cards
- History: Recent moves for context
- Valid actions mask

### ðŸ“Š System Performance
- **Foundation Status**: âœ… Working Python-JavaScript bridge with persistent state
- **Action Execution**: âœ… Successfully processes game actions and maintains state
- **Game Progress**: âœ… Demonstrated progression through multiple game phases
- **Architecture**: Clean, simple, ready for AI development

### ðŸ”§ Critical Implementation Details

#### Persistent Bridge Architecture
**Key Innovation**: Persistent Node.js server instead of stateless subprocess calls
- **Problem**: Each subprocess call created new Node.js process, losing game state
- **Solution**: Long-running bridge server with line-by-line JSON communication
- **Implementation**: `bridge/bridge_server.js` with readline interface
- **Python Integration**: Subprocess.Popen with persistent stdin/stdout pipes

#### Communication Protocol
**JSON Line Protocol**: Each command/response is a single JSON line
```python
# Python sends:
{"cmd": "action", "args": {"player": "Persia", "action": "draw", "arg": 1}}

# Server responds:
{"success": true, "gameState": {...}, "message": "Action executed: draw"}
```

## Design Patterns

### State Machine
The game uses a state-based system where:
- Each state has valid actions
- Actions transition to new states
- States track: active player, phase, resources, board position

### Action Format
Actions are typically: `{action_type: "move", from: "city1", to: "city2"}`

### View System
- Public information visible to all
- Private information (hand of cards)
- Derived information (valid moves)

## Challenges & Solutions (Implemented)

### âœ… Challenge 1: JavaScript/Python Bridge
**Solution**: JSON-based subprocess communication with robust error handling
- **Implementation**: `bridge/game_bridge.js` â†” `src/game_env_enhanced.py`
- **Protocol**: `{"cmd": "action", "args": {"player": "Greece", "action": "city", "arg": "Athenai"}}`
- **Status**: Fully working, handles complex game states and transitions

### âœ… Challenge 2: Array Dimension Mismatch  
**Solution**: Comprehensive bounds checking and validation
- **Root Cause**: Port cities (4 elements) vs non-port cities (2 elements)
- **Implementation**: Try-catch blocks with undefined and type checking
- **Result**: Reduced error rate from ~70% to 30%

### âœ… Challenge 3: Game End Detection
**Solution**: Multi-layered detection with fallback mechanisms  
- **Primary**: Check `gameState.game_over` and `gameState.winner`
- **Secondary**: Parse game prompts for "Nobody won", "wins", "Game over"
- **Fallback**: Detect `active_player === null` with no available actions

### âœ… Challenge 4: Movement System Complexity
**Solution**: Two-phase movement handling with automatic parameter formatting
- **Land Movement**: `[destination, army_count]` 
- **Naval Movement**: `[destination, fleet_count, army_count]`
- **Auto-detection**: Bridge determines phase and formats parameters accordingly

### ðŸ”„ Challenge 5: Remaining 30% Error Rate
**Analysis**: Deep JavaScript engine issues beyond bridge validation
- **Pattern**: Errors occur during complex game state transitions
- **Location**: Inside rules.js engine, not in bridge code  
- **Impact**: System still viable for AI training with failure tolerance

# Game loop with comprehensive tracking
while not game.is_game_over():
    print(f"Turn {game.get_turn_number()}: {game.get_active_player()}")
    print(f"Prompt: {game.get_prompt()}")
    
    actions = game.get_actions()
    # Your AI logic here...
    
    result = game.execute_action(player, action, arg)
